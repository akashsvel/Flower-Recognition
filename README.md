# Flower Recognition using Deep Learning (CNN)

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify flowers from images into different categories. The model is built using Keras, a high-level neural network API in Python, and TensorFlow as the backend. This repository outlines the process of preparing data, building and training the model, and visualizing predictions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a flower recognition model using deep learning. The model classifies images of flowers into different categories based on their visual characteristics. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to learn hierarchical features from images.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Flower Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition) from Kaggle. The dataset consists of images of flowers categorized into 5 classes:

- Daisy
- Dandelion
- Rose
- Sunflower
- Tulip

The images are resized and normalized to prepare them for training.

## Preprocessing the Data

Before feeding the images into the CNN model, we perform the following preprocessing steps:

1. **Image Augmentation**: Random transformations are applied to the images (rotation, flipping, scaling) to improve generalization and prevent overfitting.
   
2. **Resizing**: The images are resized to a fixed size, typically 224x224 pixels, to be compatible with the CNN model.
   
3. **Normalization**: Pixel values are scaled to a range of [0, 1] to improve training efficiency.

4. **One-Hot Encoding**: The flower classes are converted into one-hot encoded labels, where each label is represented by a binary vector.

## Building the ConvNet Model

The CNN model consists of the following layers:

1. **Convolutional Layers**: To learn spatial hierarchies in the images.
   
2. **Pooling Layers**: To reduce the spatial dimensions and keep only important features.
   
3. **Fully Connected Layers**: To classify the extracted features into flower categories.

4. **Dropout Layers**: To prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units during training.

## Model Training and Evaluation

- **Learning Rate Annealer**: A learning rate annealer is used to adjust the learning rate during training, improving the training process.
  
- **Model Compilation**: The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
  
- **Model Evaluation**: After training, the model's performance is evaluated using accuracy on the validation set.

## Visualizing the Results

1. **Visualizing Random Images**: Random images from the dataset are displayed to better understand the data before training.
   
2. **Model Predictions**: We visualize the predictions made by the trained model on the validation set to check the accuracy and potential misclassifications.

3. **Training History**: The loss and accuracy curves are plotted to visualize the model's training progress over epochs.
